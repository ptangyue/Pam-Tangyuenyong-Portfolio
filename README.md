# About me
Hi everyone! My name is Pam Tangyuenyong (She/Her).
I'm a second year MBA student at Tepper who are interested in learning more about data viz!
My background is in Accounting and here at Tepper my majors are Finance and Entrepreneurship. 
After graduation, I  will begin my work as a financial regulator in Thailand. 
My passion and longterm goals are in financial inclusion and community development.
I love to work with mission-driven organization, including startups, to create significant impact on local communities.

# What I hope to learn
Admittedly, I'm a newbie in this field.
I hope to learn more about the principles behind effective data visualizations and get hands-on experiences on those fronts. 
I also hope to be a more effective data viz critic by the end of this course! Sad but true, there were many times I found a particular data viz doesn't quite work but didn't know how to express them appropiately, let alone revise the original pieces.

# Portfolio
Here is where all my data viz will go!
