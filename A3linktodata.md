I chose this particular data visualization because I am interested in 3D printing technology and wonder why it is referred to as the coming trend for future world. Although I have heard about it a few times previously, I was not quite certain what are the benefits of this technology. Therefore, I looked up for more information online and found this article about 3D printing from Forbe. While the main story is interesting and strong on its own, the confusing data visualization distracted me to finish reading on the first sitting. It is interesting to see how internationally well-known medium like Forbe provides their audience with this difficult-to-interpret set of data visualizations. With this problematic original visualization, I am excited to see how I can apply and materialize visualization concepts I have learned so far.
