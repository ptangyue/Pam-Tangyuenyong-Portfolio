I chose this particular data visualization because I am interested in 3D printing technology and wonder why it is referred to as the coming trend for future world. Although I have heard about it a few times previously, I was not quite certain what are the benefits of this technology. Therefore, I looked up for more information online and found this article about 3D printing from Forbe. While the main story is interesting and strong on its own, the confusing data visualization distracted me to finish reading on the first sitting. It is interesting to see how internationally well-known medium like Forbe provides their audience with this difficult-to-interpret set of data visualizations. With this problematic original visualization, I am excited to see how I can apply and materialize visualization concepts I have learned so far. 

# 2. The Process 

My process consists of 4 steps including evaluating data viz by using Stephen Few’s critique method, wireframing, getting user’s feedback, and redesigning by incorporating those feedbacks. This can be illustrated as follow:

## Step 1: Evaluating original visualization 
I used Stephen Few’s 7 criteria as a guideline to critique both informative and emotive aspect of the original data viz. By diving criteria into informative and emotive aspects, the final evaluation result provides a very clear idea of what direction should the visualization be improved in priority order. This allows designer to focus their effort in the right area. In addition, the importance of each 7 criteria may vary according to industry. For example, fashion industry may prioritize Aesthetic aspect while educational professionals may find Engagement aspect more important. This led me to consider about what priority would my visualization audience, potential investor in 3D printing or material suppliers, have in their mind so that I can cater my design to best suit their need. 

While the criteria are very comprehensive, the rationale for each criteria score might not yet be as detailed as possible. This is where I apply the concepts learnt in class. For example, I applied the concept of different use of color; sequential, diverging, categorial; when ranking Usefulness and Perceptibility aspect. This is because the right use of color allows audience to grasp key messages with minimal effort. 


## Step 2: Wireframing 
When I wireframed, I used Stephen Few’s 7 criteria as a starting point. As my main audience is 3D printing investor, the two focus areas when I wireframed my work were Perceptibility and Engagement. As investors are proficient in screening out deals in uninteresting industry, it is important that the viz is easy-to-read and contain key information for investors to make primarily decision.

The main problem of the original work is its lack of ability to convey key message presented in the original narrative. The choice of viz, bar chart, is not best in representing comparison across different segments overtime. The viz also presents data  in a counterintuitive way by both using years as a bar chart , and orders it from latest to earliest year (2019 -2015). This easily led to audience misinterpretation in data, which eventually fail to capture audience’s engagement. In addition, y-axis label (%) is so simple that it fails to provide context. Last, the title is not representative of what the chart are about.

Therefore, I made adjustments as follow to tackle with key issues mentioned. 
-	Use stacked line chart instead to bar chart to better show trends overtime, and leave more white space for the whole viz
-	Change of X-axis to year and order from the earliest to latest (2015-2019)
-	Be more specific about Y-axis title (change to % of survey respondent). Get rid of % repetition 
-	Change chart title to be more specific and representative (change to “Recent trends in top3 focus of 3D printing technology” to support the key message in the article)
-	Use similar tone of color as presented in the original work because it conveys positivity and represents sequential data. I use 3 sequential colors to present Top3 trends, as highlighted in the original article, and utilize grey to provide context for those data.


## Step 3: Getting user’s feedback
Users found the sketch visualization easier to read and can understand most of the key ideas. The color tone also goes along with the main story. However, one area of concern is the variation in % of respondents presented in each year. This results from the original data set that present each element in % but accumulated over 100%. (because each survey respondent can select more than one answer) While the size of each element in my sketch should be read as accumulative, most users read it as individual. The confusion also causes audience to be less engaged in the visualization. In brief, the sketch still has issue in the aspect of Intuitiveness and Engagement.

To tackle with audience misinterpretation, I decided to change my visualization to stacked area (%). This is because the new viz will allow all data to present in scale of 100%. In addition, the size of each element will directly represent the % of respondents which is more intuitive for the audience. 


## Step 4: Redesigning
My redesigned data visualization shows the Top3 trends in 3D printing technology focus from 2015-2019. The viz highlight and compares these top 3 focus trends with other less popular ones to help the audience see the overall picture of 3D industry. Direct audience of this visualization is investor who are interested in 3D printing or potential 3D printing manufacturer. Therefore, it is important for the audience to see the direction of 3D printing in the recent years to predict future trend supporting their investment or business decision. 

I chose this data viz because it meets all the 7 criteria; usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetic and engagement. It also especially highlights Perceptibility and Engagement aspects which are likely to be the main focus for my audience, 3D printing investors. 

In brief, I used stacked area (%) instead of the original 20 separate bars to present the trend in each focus areas over the period of 5 years. The change in x-axis to year makes it more intuitive for the reader. The clarified label in y-axis makes the context clear. Repetition of information such as % are deleted, and the title is changed to be more representative of the data set.
