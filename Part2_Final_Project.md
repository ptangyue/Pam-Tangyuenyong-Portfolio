## 2. User research and Interview

### A. Target audience 

The main target audience I want to reach is people in their 20s - 40s who have elderly loved ones, including parents or grandparents.

### B. Approach to identify representative individuals to interview

As my target audience is the general public who are in their 20s-40s, I need to make sure that individuals I interview with are representative enough. Therefore, I chose three individuals with different ages, genders, and backgrounds as follow:
1. Late 20s, Female, Graduate students
2. Mid 30s, Male, Graduate student
3. Early 40s, Female, Professional
In addition, all of them expressed that they have their elderly oved one, including parents and grandparents. Whether the seniors are currently living with them or not does not matter.

### C. Interview script 

### Script
- Hello! Thank you very much for taking your time helping interview with my final project draft for Telling story with data class. My project is centered around the issue of senior scam threat and how we, the younger generation, can help protect our elderly loved one from those. Please feel free to comment on any element whether it is effective or confusing, and what I should prioritize for change. There is no right and wrong comment. All feedback is valuable and appreciated.

- To meet each of the targeted goals, I asked the following set of questions to all three participants.

### D. Interview findings

### Interviewee 1 – Late 20s, Female, Graduate student

Content
-	The overall flow is clear and structured, and interviewee can follow along very well. However, the presentation currently seems to be quite informative rather than engaging. 
-	Page 7: The context is a bit unclear. Presenter could add a brief description under each picture such as what the pictures represent and how much those two activities cost. 

Visualization
-	In general, most visualizations are easy to understand except for the pie chart.
-	Page 5:  For the age group 80s and older, putting the 16 hundred-dollar bills in two rows downplay its level of significance. The message may be more dramatic if all the 16 bills were placed in the same row.
-	Page 5: The word “4 times” is quite unclear. Is this about the frequency of scam incident or about the size of loss?
-	Page 6: It is understandable to use the same color gradient. However, the current colors are not differentiating from each other enough and make it hard for audience to interpret. 
-	Page 8: For the scam chart, it is quite counterintuitive to see the scam portion (red) to take place the caretaking service and medicare (brown and light brown), rather than the saving (grey). The visualization could be combined in page 7 as both pages currently focus on the same message. 

Call to action
-	Page 9: The call to action is very clear. She likes how the table is divided into 4 quadrants based on types of steps (preventive and corrective) and responsible person (younger generation and elderly).  




### Interviewee 2 – Mid 30s, Male, Graduate student

Content
-	Overall flow is good. The only part that does not logically progress is the order of page 6 (Type of scam). As the current page 5 and 7 mention about the loss and missed opportunity from scam, having page 6 in between interrupt the flow. Moving page 5 to be right after page 4 (Introduction of scam in U.S. aging society) would make the overall flow smoother. 
-	Page 5: It is not clear what context this scam loss is about. Is it by incident or by year?
-	Page 7: The context is a bit unclear. For example, audience wonder if the caretaking service(picture1) is on a weekly or monthly basis, and how much it cost. A brief description of both photos would be helpful. 

Visualization
-	Overall visuals are easy to understand except the use of pie chart in page 8 which is quite distracting.
-	Page 3: It is not clear to him at first glance what the orange icons represent. A description of what type of scams these are would be helpful.
-	Page 5: The visualization is pretty dense. The use of hundred-dollar bill is good However, audience find it distracting when many of them stay together. The interviewee also wonders why the bills have to be orange.  
-	Page 8: The message is pretty much the same as the previous slide. These two could be combined. 
-	Page 10:  The use of table seems very formal, too consultative. 2 intersected axes visual might be more accessible to the audience. 

Call to action
-	Clear solid immediate next steps are provided. However, he thinks the overall story could be more engaging. 




### Interviewee 3 – Early 40s, Female, Professional

Content
-	The overall flow is smooth and understandable.
-	Page 3, 4: It is interesting to see how both pages try to surprise audience with unexpected reality. However, more context is needed here. For example, the interviewee wonders about what kind of scam the orange icons represent and how much incidents have been reported so far.
-	Page 7: This page is quite vague and would need more context such as how much the two missed opportunities cost (to receive caretaking service and to pay for medicare). 

Visualization
-	Most visualizations are intuitive and easy-to-understand. The most challenging-to-interpret visuals are in page 5 and 6.
-	Page 5: Numerical number can be added at the end of each icons to help audience get solid idea. It is clear that the elderly are more susceptible to scams but it is still unclear how much scam loss for each age group are.  
-	Page 6: The color gradient is a bit confusing and not much differentiating from one another. It is also difficult to tell how much percentage each type of scam account for. 
-	Page 8: The idea that these two pie charts represent is pretty weak and could combined with the previous page. The interviewee thinks a pie chart showing how much scam account for senior income, irrespective of other costs, would be enough for the message. 

Call to action
-	There is a clear call to action. However, the interviewee thinks it could be more engaging by emphasizing the large scope of this problem. One way to make the issue alarming is to add the number of people affected in page 2 to show how many millions of seniors are susceptible to the scam threat. 
-	Since people in their 20s, 30s, 40s might have different capacity in what they can do to help, it may be helpful to be more specific about what kind of expectation each age group are up to. 




### E. Changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week to address the issues identified

To be specific in the areas of improvement, I divide the changes into two parts, story-telling and visualization. 
- For the story-telling part, the main issue that seems to resonate across all of the three interviewee is a lack of emotional attachment. The visualization helps engage audience to the topic by intriguing the audience with interesting fact and figures. However, the current presentation seems quite informative rather than emotionally compelling. 

To address this issue, I plan to use persona tactic throughout the story to help increase audience’s emotional attachment. Another element I might add at the beginning of the project is the short, actual footage of senior scam. Earlier I came across some actual footages of senior scam which are both disturbing and heartbreaking. So, I think incorporating these actual elements might help my message be more impactful. In addition, I plan to rearrange the order of slide a bit to help with the flow; move the current page 6 to be right after page 4. 


- For the visualization part, there are a couple of visualizations that seems to be distracting or incomplete. Below are my plans to address each of the issue.  

1. Type of scam bar chart (page 6) 

Most feedbacks mention the concern about the use of gradient and the use of horizontal bar, which make it hard to tell % for audience to tell % each scam account for. To address these issues, I plan to use consider pick two significant scams and use different tone of colors, such as red and yellow, while use grey for the other types. In addition, I plan to use a pie chart with % on it to help audience easily interpret the proportion. 

2. Dollar icon (page 5) 

The most common theme of feedback is that it is hard to see the number through dollar note and it is unclear why the notes are orange. To address these concerns, I plan to change these orange bank notes into black bank note icon as well as putting numerical number at the end of the chart to make it more convenient for audience to quantify the scam effect.

3. U.S. aging society (page 3 and 4)/ It’s not about money (page 7) 

While the interviewee could understand the key takeaway for each of these pages, they seem to be unclear in terms of the visual context. To further improve audience engagement, I plan to provide more specific context in all these pages so that the message is more tangible to the audience. In addition, I plan to recreate a pie chart in page 8, to solely focus on the scam portion in relative to the senior income, and combine this new chart with the information in page 7.
