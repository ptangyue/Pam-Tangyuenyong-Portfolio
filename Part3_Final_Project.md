## A summary of steps taken to finalize my final project on Shorthand

Please note that details of changes are explained in the next section “Change/Design decision made after Part II”. 

**1.	Modify visualizations according to user interview in Part II** 

These include changes in visualization types and color choice. 

**2.	Create an initial shorthand version of final project**

This was the first time I put all my storyboard and wireframe ideas into practice. With all the text descriptions included, the story flow changed as senior scam information was now all over the place. To make the content more engaging, the major updates were an addition of persona, a change in introduction page (lure procedure), and the use of dark tone photos as a background.

**3.	User interview & Remodification**

I used the same set of interview questions as in Part II to interview three users; late 20s male, mid 30s women, and late 30s women. 

With the use of persona, the audience felt more connected to the story. However, users felt lost in the middle of the story as some information seemed to be disconnected with each other. To address this issue, I divided the whole story into three sections: Basic information about senior scam, Implication and Effect, and Immediate next step. To make the story flow more smoothly, I used my two cartoons, Susan and Paul, to inform the audience about the story direction. In addition, I added several visualizations to provide audience with a broader background knowledge about senior scam. 



## Identified audiences
My intended audience is younger adult in their 20s-40s. Persona is also use as part of the storytelling. The main protagonists are 75 year-old grandma and her 30 year-old grandson. 



## Details of changes and Design decisions made after Part II

There were several major changes I made when creating my page in shorthand. Parts of them were from the user interviews in Part II, and some of them arose as I saw fit. The changes can be divided in to Story Telling part and Visualization part.

### Story-Telling Part
**1.	Using persona**

According to user interviews in Part II, one of the main issues in my presentation was a lack of audience engagement, which resulted in low enthusiasm to take recommended actions. Therefore, I decided to use persona strategy by creating two main characters, 75-year-old grandma Susan who suffered from a senior romance, and 25-year-old grandson Paul. With this, audience will learn about each areas of the senior scam as the story of how grandma Susan was trapped unfolds. 

As a result, audiences in the latest interview felt very engaged with the topic and were compelled to take action to protect their elderly loved ones. 

**2.	Dividing story into 3 parts**

While diverse information about scams allow user to see the issue extensively, some users found the information unconnected with each other. They felt lost in the middle of the story. To address this issue, I grouped similar topics together and divided them into three parts: Part I (General information about senior scams), Part II (Implication and effect), and Part III (Call to actions). To help connect audience with the topic, I introduced each of the section from the perspective of grandson Paul character. 

Both the section division and introduction through persona significantly improved the story clarity and audience engagement to each topic. 

**3.	Extensively using actual photos with dark background**

Instead of the plain white background, I utilized a lot of dark-tone senior photo as my background throughout the story. The actual photos of senior depressing and suffering faces effectively created a strong sense of audience empathy to the topic. According to the latest user interview, many felt emotional after seeing those photos. 


### Visualization Part
**1.	Getting rid of the stacked line that represents aging population trend**

Initially I planned to use this stacked line graph to give audiences an impression of the large effect scope. However, instead of giving the percentage growth of elderly population, I thought it would be more impactful to directly address the number of senior victims (3Millions, 1 in every 20 seniors). According to the users, these figures effectively gave them a sense of how large the effect of senior scams are, and therefore created a sense of urgency to take action. 

**2.	Getting rid of the heavy icon page that introduces that idea of senior scams**

The initial heavy icon page would include a lot of opportunities and threats in the US aging societies. When creating that page in shorthand however, I found the density of icon and their context information distracting. To directly introduce the topic to the audience, I decided to go with the idea of using one senior photo as a background and changing the color tone from colorful and bright to black and white. In addition, I included a few thought-provoking questions in both pages to fully follow the lure procedure technic. In the latest interview, most audiences found this tactic naturally captured their attentions upfront. 

**3.	Redesigning the icon visual for the size of scam loss by age group** 

The initial visual representing this information was full of colored dollar bills. Most users found this visualization confusing and distractive. Therefore, I changed this into horizontal bar charts. This was much easier to interpret and effectively supported my intention to show significant difference between younger adult and elderly. 

**4.	Redesigning the bar chart for scam types**

Most users found this horizontal percentage bar chart with gradient color ineffective. Many audiences felt that knowledge of actual amount of loss or number of cases would be more impactful. To redesign, I created horizontal bar charts ordering from the largest loss to the smallest. In addition, I used two different colors to highlight only the top two types that the audience should be highly aware of. 

**5.	Using a combination of pie chart and equation to represent the cost of scams on senior income**

In the initial design, I used two pie charts to represent the how average senior income and expense look like before and after scam. However, many audiences found this confusing and therefore ended up disregarding it. For the redesign, I used a pie chart and equation to present the ideas.  A pie chart showed audiences how much the scam loss takes from senior average incomes. An equation directly informed them how much this loss translates into other healthcare opportunity losses with red highlight on the important figurers. In the final user interview, users found this understandable and impactful. 

**6.	Including more supporting data and visualization** 

Strong supporting data do not only give the audience a solid contextual background, but they also provide audience insights to the topic. Therefore, I incorporated other additional data to make my project more solid. The information includes numbers of senior scam report by contact method, top payment method for senior scam, and healthcare opportunity loss.

**7.	Redesigning call to action page**

I planned to use table for this call to action page in the wireframe. However, after playing around with shorthand layout, I changed my mind.  The initial 4 quadrant table would make the less dense quadrant look less urgent and less impactful. For the redesign, I decided to combine all the required actions for younger adult into one section, as so was the senior part. I also incorporated the persona character here to make ensure persona is consistent throughout the story. In the final data story, audiences found this section very clear and easy-to-follow.
