It is very interesting to see how these three visualizations convey different messages to the audience even though all of them are based on the same data set. In chart 1, the audience is presented with a snapshot of the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 across different countries. The audience can also easily rank the country with lowest to highest ratio as data is presented in order from left to right end on the x-axis. 

To present the trend of each country’s data set over time, the grid of line chart used in chart 2 however is a better data visualization. By separating each country’s data set from each other, it is easier for the audience to focus on the data of any particular country. This way, it is also clearer to see a different pattern of ratio that emerges over time from each country.

Last, I chose to compare Japan’s government debt-to-GDP with its USA counterparts. Unlike the other two visualizations, this horizontal bar chart is dynamic by the year presents. This is done so that audience can not only compare both Japan and USA data point but also see their relevant context from other OECD countries, grey bars.  The government debt-to-GDP ratio implies negativity to some extent. Therefore, the colors for proponent data sets here, Japan and USA, are red and darkish blue to imply relevant messages.
